# Final-Project-JCC-Golang-2021

This is a repository dedicated for Jabar Coding Camp 2021 Golang Final Project (RESTful API).

## | Framework used

- Gin (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)

- GORM (https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)

## | How To Run

To run this API project, run this command on your terminal (or command-line, if you're on Windows).

    go run server.go

And the API should work just fine.

## | Documentation

Read `Documentation.md`.

## | SQL Database Schema

Go to `resources/Final-Project-API-SQL-Schema.png` or for the MySQl Workbench file `resources/Final-Project-API-SQL-Schema.mwb`

**Note : Don't forget to set the .env on your own machine. Otherwise, the API would not work.**

**Note 2 : If you're going to use this on cloud (e.g Heroku), there's no need to set the .env file, use the config vars provided by your platform.**

***Personal and educational-use only.***
